A tutorial project from the website:
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

My goals are to get more comfortable with basic html, css and git/github.
Hopefully by the end of my tinkering I will have a clone of google's webpage, from scratch, albeit without working links.
